​	I devoted the whole day today to learning how to use prompts to make better use of AI. I delved deeply into the methods and strategies for writing effective prompts, including understanding the characteristics and requirements of prompts in different types of AI application scenarios. Through numerous examples and practical operation exercises, I attempted to use specific prompts to guide AI to produce accurate and desired results in aspects such as text generation, problem-solving, and image creation.

​	From the learning process, I understood that writing prompts is like having a special conversation with AI, and I need to organize language from the "perspective of AI's understanding". For example, in text generation, factors such as the clarity of the prompt's theme and the limitation of its style directly affect the quality and direction of the text output by AI. In terms of image creation, the more detailed the description in the prompt is, such as colors, compositional elements, and scene features, the more the generated image can meet expectations. This shows that we can deeply tap into the capabilities of AI through ingenious prompt design and transform it into a powerful tool for solving various complex tasks, whether it's creative content creation or logical problem-solving.
