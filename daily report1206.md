​	Today, I spent the whole day working with the entire team on in-depth requirements analysis. Firstly, we started drawing User Personas by leveraging a large amount of market research data, user feedback information, and in-depth discussions on business objectives. For example, we conducted detailed analyses and summaries of multiple dimensions such as the age, gender, occupation, hobbies, and usage scenarios of the target user group, and constructed representative fictional user profiles. Like "Xiao Li, a young professional, often needs to use mobile office software to handle urgent documents during business trips and pays great attention to the convenience and stability of the software."

​	Next, based on the User Personas, we carefully drew User Journeys, meticulously sorting out all the stages, touchpoints, and emotional changes that users experience from their first contact with the product to becoming loyal users. Taking an online education product as an example, the User Journey includes a series of steps such as learning about courses from advertisements, registering an account, taking trial courses, purchasing formal courses, interacting during the learning process, and obtaining certificates after completing the studies, clearly defining the users' needs and expectations at each stage.

​	Subsequently, the team collaborated to write User Stories, stating the functional requirements from the user's perspective. For instance, "As a photography enthusiast, I hope to quickly find various filter effects in the photo editing software so that I can easily add a unique style to my photographic works", ensuring that each story accurately reflects the connection between user value and product functions.

​	From a theoretical perspective, User Personas provide clear characteristics of the target user group for product design, enabling us to meet the specific needs and expectations of particular users in a targeted manner during the design process and avoid the generalization and blindness of product functions. User Journeys further visualize the interaction process between users and the product, helping us identify pain points, pleasant points, and potential optimization opportunities in the user's usage process, providing a powerful basis for product function design and process optimization. User Stories, as a requirement expression method in agile development, effectively promote communication and collaboration among team members (including those with different functions such as development, design, and testing), ensure that all parties have a consistent understanding of product requirements, and improve development efficiency and product quality. The determination of the MVP is an important decision based on the lean startup concept. By quickly launching a product with core functions, obtaining user feedback as early as possible, realizing the rapid iteration and optimization of the product, reducing product development risks, and improving the product's market adaptability and competitiveness.

​	From a practical perspective, if the User Personas drawn today can accurately reflect the target user group, then in the subsequent product design, we will be able to position functions and design interfaces more accurately. For example, we can optimize the layout and interaction methods of the product interface according to the visual preferences and operating habits of users in specific age groups. The sorting out of User Journeys can help us determine the priority of product development and focus resources on the links that users pay high attention to and have a great impact on the experience, such as optimizing the user registration and first-time usage experience to improve the user retention rate. The standardization and clarity of the writing of User Stories directly affect the work efficiency of the development team and the integrity of product functions. If User Stories can accurately convey user needs and meet development standards, misunderstandings and rework in the development process will be greatly reduced. The determination of the MVP sets clear goals and scopes for the product's first launch, avoiding project delays and resource waste caused by over-development. Meanwhile, it also provides a clear selling point and value proposition for the product's marketing and user acquisition. For example, attracting early users with simple and efficient core functions and then gradually improving product functions according to user feedback.
