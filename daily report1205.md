​	This morning, I focused on learning how to determine user stories and define Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) to complete the initial product in the first iteration. I deeply studied the key points of writing user stories, which include starting from the user's perspective and accurately describing the user's needs, goals, and expected outcomes. For example, for a social software, a user story like "As a user, I want to be able to add friends conveniently so that I can quickly expand my social circle" was written. At the same time, I carefully analyzed the process and methods of determining MVPs. Through sorting and screening the core functions of the product, the most critical and indispensable function sets in the first iteration were identified. For example, the MVP of an online shopping APP might focus on product display, shopping cart function, and a simple payment process.

	During the learning process of determining user stories, I deeply realized the importance of understanding the user's psychology and needs, which requires us to have sharp user insight and good empathy. At first, when writing user stories, it was easy to fall into the misunderstanding of focusing too much on technical implementation details rather than user value. After continuous adjustment and learning, I gradually mastered the user-centered writing skills. When determining the MVP, I realized that this is a difficult process of trade-offs under limited resources, and it is necessary to resolutely exclude those non-core functional requirements. This is a challenge to the thinking of always pursuing functional completeness, but it also made me realize the key significance of focusing on the core value in the initial stage of the product. I reflected that in future product planning, the concept of lean startup should always be adhered to, and functional redundancy and resource waste should be avoided.
